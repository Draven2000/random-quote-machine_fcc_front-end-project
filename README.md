freeCodeCamp, Front End Development Libraries Projects project 1.

github preview struggles to load react components, hence I used codepen to preview my page instead:

A project to showcase using react-redux to design webpages and manage state. A simple random qoute generator that shows the user a random qoute selected from an object containing qoutes and their author.

A repo showcasing a collection of my other freeCodeCamp projects may be found here:
